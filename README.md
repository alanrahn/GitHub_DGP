# GitHub_DGP

DGP and Lattice beta code

The public GitHub repository is not used for development. All development occurs in a private Azure DevOps repository (formerly Visual Studio Team Services). The GitHub version is a copy of the Azure DevOps repository that is updated periodically to match the private repository. Its main purpose is to provide a public "read-only" snapshot of the code for anyone that is interested in viewing it. This GitHub repository can be used to track issues, however.

All documentation for DGP is available from two sources. One is the documentation embedded within the source code of the DGP WebApp. The other is a web site that hosts the same DGP WebApp that is embedded in the source code http://45.32.194.87/WebApp/Documentation/DocsIndex.html.
