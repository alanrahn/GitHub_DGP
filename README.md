# GitHub_DGP
read-only copy of the real Git repository


DGP and Lattice beta code

The public GitHub repository is not used for development. All development occurs in a private Azure DevOps repository (formerly Visual Studio Team Services). The GitHub version is basically a clone of the Azure DevOps repository that is updated periodically so that the code matches the published assemblies of each release. Its main purpose is to provide a public "read-only" snapshot of the code for anyone that is interested in viewing it. This GitHub repository IS used to track issues, however - at least for the period of DGP's beta.

All documentation for DGP is available from two sources. One is the documentation embedded within the source code of the DGP WebApp. The other is a web site that hosts the same DGP WebApp that is embedded in the source code, made available for those that don't want to download the source code and host it themselves just to be able to read the documentation.
